# What Willow Is (And Isnâ€™t)

Willow itself is not a complete and direct replacement for Amazon Echo/Google Home. Willow has a fairly limited focus:

- Support wake word to start recording.
- Use VAD to know when you stop talking.
- Get the cleanest, highest quality audio possible.
- Do something useful with the audio (stream to a server for speech to text or use local command recognition).
- Send the output text to something to do actually do something.
- Display the command results (and in the future) play back any audio that comes back from the command server (such as text to speech output).
- Provide an interface for feedback via the LCD display and speaker output.

That's it!
